Key points:

* Logistic regression is the simplest neural net with one layer and one neuron with sigmoid activation function

* You can think of a neuron as a function which creates more abstract feature from its input

* Deeper layers represent more complicated features. For example, the first layer in CNN detects edges; next layer detects parts of the face, next layer detects faces, etc. In speech recognition, the first layer can detect low and high frequencies; next layer detects specific sounds, next layer phonemes, etc. 

* The architecture of the network depends on the task. CNN for images, RNNs for sequence data, hybrid for complicated tasks as self-driving cars. 

* Why Deep learning is taking off? Several reasons: neural nets have a property of improving with bigger and bigger amount of data (unlike other algorithms). 
Today we have a big amount of data, and the neural net can help with solving such tasks. Also, computational power, GPUs allows to relatively quickly experiment with NN. Deep NN showed better results in many fields than classic approaches.

* Often other algorithms than NN can give better results for small- and moderate size data. 

* "AI is the new electricity," means AI is transforming many industries like electricity.
